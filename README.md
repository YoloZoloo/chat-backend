# Chat-backend

I almost always had a doubt about having the need to use Messenger, Skype or other platforms to text or video call my family. 
Either I had to pay for the service or I had to grant these companies access to my personal data. This unwillingness of mine to rely on free services combined with the need to upskill nudged me toward writing my own chat application.
I am hoping to add more features such as streaming, video call etc. But unfortunately, due to the limitations of working alone I will resort to coding only the chat application for now.

I believe anyone should be able to create a video call or texting platform if they have their own server.
